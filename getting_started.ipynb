    "### General Thoughts & Questions\n",
    "#### Please answer the following questions:\n",
    "* What are your preferred pronouns and would you like to be called by a different name than your legal name?\n",
    "  > She/her, and Amanda is fine.\n",
    "* Describe your engineering interests and experience.\n",
    "  > I am an ECE with a strong interest in software, but have designed and built around 7 PCBs. I've used multiple buck converter circuits, but without a real theoretical understanding of how it works. You may remember last semester I sent an email about how to create a 50V to 19V converter -- we ended up not needing that, and I ended up using an off the shelf part for the 60V to 12V on there now. As a result of needing to do this, I've learned some amount about hot loops, loop area, inductors storing energy in their magnetic field and the basic theory behind buck converters but there's definitely a lot more to be learned.\n",
    "* What would you like to get out of this course?\n",
    "  > I want to become an engineer more confident in the theory of electronics, rather than just the practice of it. I have a solid amount of practical experience from Olin projects, project teams and internships, but I don't feel like my theoretical basis is as strong as it should be despite having aptitude towards strong first-principles and theoretical thinking pre-Olin.\n",
    "* Which aspect(s) of power electronics do you find interesting?\n",
    "  > How to create efficient, low-noise, and low-ripple buck and boost converters. Also, how EMI/EMC relates to the design of such converters, since right now EMI/EMC is sort of a magical thing that I try to avoid by using various best practices from the internet that I hope solve my problems (again, without really understanding mathematically why those practices might be important).\n",
    "* How might the field of power electronics help with environmental and social issues?\n",
    "  > Power is involved in literally every electronic system we have, which is of course interlinked with the usage of energy. Energy is hugely important on a geopolitical scale, and creating efficient electrical systems reduces the amount of energy we need to \"create\" and therefore the amount of pollution we release into the world.

    "### First Explorations\n",
    "#### Please navigate the map of Power Electronics and answer the following questions (note: if the map does not load correctly, use the Canvas App or try a different browser):\n",
    "* Provide an example for a mixed-signal circuit.\n",
    "  > A gate driver circuit compatible with PWM control that can level-shift.\n",
    "* What type of quantities are typically measured for the control and protection of power converters?\n",
    "  > Current, voltage, and temperature.\n",
    "* What is the \"loop\" in loop shaping?\n",
    "  > The loop in loop shaping refers to the control loop, as defined by a transfer function, of a closed-loop system.\n",
    "* How does mechanical engineering apply to the design of power converters?\n",
    "  > Packaging is a huge part of power electronics and is very important to the success of the electronic, especially in regards to wicking away heat. Other very important mechanical design considerations include vibration, EMI, thermal, and space constraints.\n",
    "* What purpose do inductors serve in power converters?\n",
    "  > Inductors store energy in their magnetic field to filter the high frequency harmonics that come from the voltage modulation away.\n",
    "* What is currently \"all the rage\" in the field of power electronics?\n",
    "  > Wide-bandgap devices, which are capable of operating at higher temperatures with much less switching loss than conventional silicon devices.\n",
    "* Who is James Worden?\n",
    "  > James Worden is the co-founder of Solectria, a company which makes powerful large scale high-voltage inverters.\n",
    "* Why does the efficiency of a power converter matter?\n",
    "  >  A more efficient power converter is a more reliable and cooler converter. High-power converters need to be especially efficient or else even 1% losses can result in huge amounts of heat.\n",
    "* Which are some of the key powerstage components?\n",
    "  > Power semiconductors (like MOSFETs and diodes), magnetics (i.e. inductors and transformers), capacitors, and protective components.\n",
    "* List multiple ways of getting hurt or killed when working on a power converter.\n",
    "  > You can get shocked, burned, or hit with debris.\n",
    "* How do you plan on staying safe.\n",
    "  > Wearing safety glasses and not touching the lab hardware while it's on."

    "### Lab Hardware\n",
    "#### Please review the Lab Hardware assembly assignment and answer the following questions:\n",
    "* Are you comfortable with this assignment? If not, what type of assistance would be helpful?\n",
    "  > Very comfortable, in fact we finished populating it already! Although we will be repopulating to properly document everything. At least now we have a spare?\n",
    "* When is the fully assembled hardware due?\n",
    "  > February 19th.\n",
    "* What type of documentation of the assembly process is requested?\n",
